# 🎯 Assignment Creation & Display Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Assignment Creation API Error**

- **Problem**: `rubric_criteria` was being sent as a column to assignments table
- **Solution**: Modified `createAssignment()` to extract `rubric_criteria` and handle it separately in `assignment_rubrics` table
- **File**: `src/lib/api/assignments.ts`

### 2. **Mock Data Instead of Real Assignments**

- **Problem**: Assignment tab was showing hardcoded mock data instead of database assignments
- **Solution**:
  - Added real assignment fetching with `getGroupAssignments()` API
  - Added state management for assignments in GroupDetail component
  - Added loading states and error handling
- **Files**:
  - `src/components/groups/group-detail.tsx`
  - `src/components/assignments/assignment-management-tab.tsx`
  - `src/components/assignments/enhanced-assignment-list.tsx`

### 3. **Missing Assignment Refresh**

- **Problem**: Created assignments didn't appear immediately
- **Solution**: Added `onAssignmentCreated` callback to refresh assignment list after creation
- **Files**: `src/components/assignments/create-assignment-dialog.tsx`

### 4. **Toast Notifications**

- **Problem**: Using wrong toast library (sonner vs custom useToast)
- **Solution**: Updated to use project's custom `useToast` hook
- **File**: `src/components/assignments/create-assignment-dialog.tsx`
